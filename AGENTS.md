# Board sweeps (cross-runtime Linear automation)

Four Linear board sweeps drive features from idea -> shipped on the **Codex** team's **Linear Sweep** project, with a human gate before anything reaches production. They are **canonical, cross-runtime skills**: the same `SKILL.md` files run under Claude Code (discovered natively) and Codex (via this section). Read the whole `SKILL.md` before acting.

## Coding workflow

- For any task involving writing, reviewing, debugging, refactoring, or otherwise changing code, invoke the installed Andrej Karpathy skill (`andrej-karpathy-skill` from the `andrej-karpathy-skills` plugin) before starting that work.
- If the skill is unavailable in the current session, apply its core checks manually: think before coding, keep the change simple, make surgical edits, and verify the goal before calling the work complete.

**Config:** all four read `.claude/linear-sweep.json` at the repo root for the team/project/prefix and repo-specific paths - nothing is hardcoded. Team `Codex` (key `COD`), project `Linear Sweep`, issue prefix `COD-###`. Deploy path: No production app deploy for this kit. Shipping is merge/push to main; any release publishing or external distribution step must be attended by the owner or tracked as a Todo card. Optional `reviewLenses` gate card-type review lenses; `requireShipApproval` hardens the ship gate. `parallel.maxNonShipDispatches` counts workspace/sweep candidates; `parallel.sameRepoCardLimits` counts same-repo per-card child slots inside a selected non-ship candidate. Ship remains serial.

**Codex tool mapping (all four):** read/search/git via `shell`; edit files via `apply_patch`; subagents via `spawn_agent`/`wait_agent`/`close_agent` (needs `[features] multi_agent = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml`); progress via `update_plan`; run the dev server via `shell` in the background (no `preview_*` tools on Codex). Use your own commit attribution - not the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer shown in the files. Detect worktree/branch state with read-only git before creating/finishing branches.

- **Spec sweep** - "Spec" -> "Dev" (docs-only, + card-type-gated design/devex/security plan reviews): `.claude/skills/spec-sweep/SKILL.md`. Engineering review runs in prose mode (auto-decide via prose; never AskUserQuestion, never BLOCKED).
- **Dev sweep** - "Dev" -> "QA" (writes code on a worktree, claims active work with `dev:in-progress`, gated security/perf/design lenses, code review + an independent reviewer subagent, verifies green, pushes the branch, no merge): `.claude/skills/dev-sweep/SKILL.md`.
- **QA sweep** - "QA" -> "Signoff" (smoke-test as a user via `/qa`, `/design-review`, fix UX bugs, screenshots to the card; **never merges, never deploys**): `.claude/skills/qa-sweep/SKILL.md`.
- **Ship sweep** - "Ship" -> "Done" (the only sweep that merges + deploys; canary-verifies; resume-on-merge-commit): `.claude/skills/ship-sweep/SKILL.md`. **Single-runner** (pin dispatch to one host) and fires only on cards a human moved into "Ship".
- **Unblock sweep** - manual-only interactive review of cards carrying `blocked:open-questions`, `blocked:needs-user`, `qa:needs-changes`, or `sweep:manual-only` across registered anchors: `.claude/skills/unblock-sweep/SKILL.md`. Never scheduled; clears blockers only after a human supplies a resolution.

**Statuses:** Backlog -> Spec -> Dev -> QA -> **Signoff** -> **Ship** (human-only move) -> Done. Active development is `Dev` plus `dev:in-progress`; the old `In Progress` state is legacy cleanup only. Plus **`Todo`** = a human-only action item the agent can't do (DNS, a dashboard secret, a third-party console step, a deploy the agent can't trigger); sweeps spin these off and link them to the feature card so the user has one tracked to-do list. Also Canceled/Duplicate/Archived. **Workflow labels:** `spec:in-progress`, `dev:in-progress`, `qa:in-progress`, `qa:needs-changes`, `qa:passed`, `ship:in-progress`, `ship:approved`, `fast-path:eligible`, `blocked:open-questions`, `blocked:needs-user`, `sweep:manual-only`.

**Auth:** `LINEAR_API_KEY` lives in the gitignored `.env` at repo root (`set -a && . ./.env && set +a`), never committed.

## Linear feature tracking (going forward)

Track every product/engineering feature, bug, or product-impacting change on the Linear Sweep board. Find or create a `COD-*` issue for the work itself (not meta "design X" cards - attach specs/plans/review notes to the feature card). Put the `COD-###` key in the branch name / commit subjects where practical. Raw ideas -> Backlog; selected-but-underspecified -> Spec; designed/active -> Dev (active work carries `dev:in-progress`); PR/review -> QA; QA-passed, awaiting sign-off -> Signoff; human-approved to ship -> Ship; shipped/verified -> Done. Work discovered after the fact -> a `Done` card titled `Completed: ...` with a short summary + evidence.
