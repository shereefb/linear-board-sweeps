# Linear board rules

The sweeps assume this board shape. `scripts/linear.mjs setup-team` creates anything missing.

## Statuses (workflow states)

The pipeline flows left → right. Linear ships most of these by default; the sweeps add five (`Needs Spec`, `Ready for Dev`, `QA Passed`, `Ready to Ship`, `Archived`). `QA Passed` and `Ready to Ship` are positioned between `In Review` and `Done`. **`Ready to Ship` is the human gate: only a person moves a card into it, and ship-sweep merges + deploys only from there.**

| Status | Type | Meaning | Who moves it here |
|--------|------|---------|-------------------|
| `Backlog` | backlog | Raw idea, not yet selected | human |
| `Needs Spec` | unstarted | Selected but under-specified | human, or dev-sweep bouncing a weak card |
| `Ready for Dev` | unstarted | Designed + spec'd + eng-reviewed | **spec-sweep** |
| `In Progress` | started | Actively being built | **dev-sweep** (or human) |
| `In Review` | started | Built, pushed, awaiting QA | **dev-sweep** |
| `QA Passed` | started | Smoke-tested green, evidence attached, awaiting human sign-off | **qa-sweep** |
| `Ready to Ship` | started | Human reviewed and approved shipping | **human, manually (only)** |
| `Done` | completed | Merged + deployed + canary-verified | **ship-sweep** |
| `Todo` | unstarted | **A human action item the agent can't do** (see below) | dev/qa-sweep (or any sweep) spins these off |
| `Canceled` | canceled | Won't do | human |
| `Duplicate` | duplicate | Superseded by another card | anyone |
| `Archived` | completed | Recorded for history; superseded/retired work | anyone |

### The `Todo` lane — things only the user can do

`Todo` is the board's hand-off lane for **work the agent cannot perform itself and must delegate to the human.** Whenever a sweep hits a step that requires a person — a credential, a console click, a real-world action — it does **not** silently block or drop it. It extracts a `Todo` card describing exactly what the user must do, links it to the feature card, and keeps going. The scheduled launcher can also create system-owned `Todo` cards for operator-visible tick failures, marked with `[auto-sweep-tick-failure <fingerprint>]`. This gives the user a single tracked list of "what's waiting on me."

Typical `Todo` cards:

- **Infra / DNS** — add a DNS record, point a domain, configure a CDN.
- **Credentials & secrets** — provision an API key, set an env var in the hosting dashboard (Vercel/Fly/etc.), rotate a token.
- **Third-party portals** — register a webhook in an external console, connect an OAuth app, verify a sender domain, upload an app to a store.
- **Platform / deploy steps the agent can't trigger** — apply a prod DB migration, run a one-off deploy command, flip a feature flag in a SaaS UI.
- **Account / billing / legal** — approve a paid plan, sign a DPA, grant a permission the agent lacks.
- **Scheduled launcher failures** — fix a broken runtime command, unreachable Linear query, stale reaper write, auto-update failure, or other operator issue that prevents a tick from completing normally.

Each human hand-off `Todo` card should state, in plain language: *what* to do, *where* (which dashboard/console), and *why* (which feature it unblocks). When the user finishes it, they move the card to `Done` (or comment "done") and the linked feature can proceed. A human hand-off `Todo` is never something the agent could have done itself — if the agent can do it, it does, and no card is created.

Scheduled launcher failure `Todo` cards are deduplicated by fingerprint. Repeated ticks update the existing card at most daily unless the normalized error changes. When a later tick checks the same scope without seeing the failure, the launcher comments `[auto-sweep-tick-recovered <fingerprint> <ISO>]` and moves the Todo to `Done`. If config or credentials are too broken to write Linear, no impossible Todo is attempted; the failure stays visible in local logs and `linear-watch.mjs health` exits non-zero.

## Workflow labels

Claim/release + blocked signals. The sweeps create these if missing.

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `spec:in-progress` | spec-sweep owns this card (stale after 45 min) |
| `dev:in-progress` | dev-sweep owns this card (stale after 90 min) |
| `qa:in-progress` | qa-sweep owns this card (stale after 120 min) |
| `qa:needs-changes` | QA found problems; back to the author |
| `qa:passed` | qa-sweep's green signal; ship-sweep's pre-merge evidence |
| `ship:in-progress` | ship-sweep owns this card (stale after 120 min) |
| `ship:approved` | *(optional)* deliberate human ship approval, required only when `config.requireShipApproval` is true |
| `blocked:open-questions` | spec-sweep asked the owner questions; waiting on a reply |
| `blocked:needs-user` | dev/qa/ship blocked on a human (decision, credential, deploy) |

Type labels (`Feature`/`Bug`/`Improvement` or your team's equivalent), Severity, and domain labels are optional and team-specific — the sweeps don't require them.

## The `auto-sweep` project label (activation for the launcher)

`auto-sweep` is a **project-level** label (not an issue label), and it is the on/off switch for the auto-sweep launcher (`scripts/linear-watch.mjs`). A registered workspace is swept automatically **iff its Linear project carries this label** — add it in the Linear UI to activate a project, remove it to pause, without touching the machine that runs the launcher. Projects without it are ignored even if their anchor is registered.

The launcher also writes/reads a few **audit-marker comments** on cards (you don't create these by hand): `[auto-sweep-heartbeat <ISO>]` (a running sweep proving it's alive), `[auto-sweep-reaper]` (a stale claim it auto-released), `[auto-sweep-bounce <from>→<to>]` (a card that moved backward — two within 48h and the card is parked with `blocked:needs-user`), `[auto-sweep-tick-failure <fingerprint>]` (a self-clearing scheduled launcher failure Todo), and `[auto-sweep-tick-recovered <fingerprint> <ISO>]` (the launcher observed recovery and moved that Todo to Done).

## Manual unblock workflow

`unblock-sweep` is a human-invoked skill for reviewing cards that carry `blocked:open-questions`, `blocked:needs-user`, or `qa:needs-changes` across all registered anchors, including paused projects. It shows one blocked card at a time, records the user's resolution in a Linear audit comment, and removes only the selected blocking label(s). It is copied to anchors for Claude/Codex discovery but is not part of scheduled `SWEEPS`.

## Tracking rules (going forward)

- One card = one product/engineering feature, bug, or user outcome. **Not** meta-cards like "design X" or "write the plan" — attach the design doc, plan, review notes, and verification evidence to the feature card instead.
- Put the `<PREFIX>-###` key in the branch name / PR title / commit subjects where practical.
- Raw ideas → `Backlog`. Selected-but-underspecified → `Needs Spec`. Designed → `Ready for Dev`. Active → `In Progress`. PR/review → `In Review`. QA-passed, awaiting sign-off → `QA Passed`. Human-approved to ship → `Ready to Ship`. Shipped + verified → `Done`.
- Work discovered after the fact → a `Done` card titled `Completed: …` with a short plain-English summary + evidence.
- Every question during an unattended sweep run goes to a **card comment** — never block on interactive input.
